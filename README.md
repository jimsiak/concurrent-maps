# Concurrent Map Data Structures

This repository contains a large variety of concurrent map implementations and
benchmarks to validate and evaluate their performance. The main focus is to
create a collection of as many concurrent maps as possible to facilitate the
evaluation and comparison of different synchronization techniques.

This collection of concurrent maps contains implementations that use the following
synchronization techniques:
 * Locks
 * Atomic operations
 * Read-Copy-Update
 * Transactional Memory
